# Adaptive-Linguistic-Prompting-ALP-Enhances-Phishing-Webpage-Detection-in-Multimodal-LLMs

Abstract: 
Phishing attacks represent a significant cybersecurity threat, necessitating adaptive detection techniques. This study explores the use of Few-Shot Adaptive Linguistic Prompting (ALP) in detecting phishing webpages through the multimodal capabilities of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro. ALP is a structured reasoning framework that guides LLMs to analyze textual deception by breaking down linguistic patterns, detecting urgency cues, and identifying manipulative diction commonly found in phishing content. By integrating textual, visual, and URL-based analysis, we propose a unified model capable of identifying sophisticated phishing attempts. Our experiments demonstrate that ALP significantly enhances phishing detection accuracy by guiding LLMs through structured reasoning and contextual analysis. The findings highlight the potential of ALP-integrated multimodal LLMs to advance phishing detection frameworks, achieving an F1-score of 0.93â€”surpassing traditional approaches. These results establish a foundation for more robust, interpretable, and adaptive phishing detection systems.
